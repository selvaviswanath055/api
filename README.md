An API using nodeJS.
Create an env file and store the token keys in appropriate variables as metioned with in the code.
I have used mongoDB But you can configure for your own purpose.

This app is developed for general purpose(like a Boiler code) and included as many functions as possible and
also followed the general ExpressJS structure even for the names of the Folders.
Feel free to modify and use it as you like.
